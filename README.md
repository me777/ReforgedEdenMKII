Empyrion Galactic Survival - Reforged Eden Scenario Enhancements

* Credit  
It's a hackjob of the original mod, and I took out a lot of stuff...  
Also I stole code from ASTICs EmpyrionScripting https://github.com/GitHub-TC/EmpyrionScripting  

__*DISCLAIMER*__ This mod uses API1 and therefore can only run on dedicated servers. If you want to use this mod for a single player game you will need to host your own local dedicated server.

## Installation

Get the "ReforgedEdenMKII.zip" from the relases section and extract into your "Empyrion - Dedicated Server\Content\Mods"

## Features

### Warp Gate Enhancements

Once you have activated the progenitor warp gate, any player (piloting a CV) that comes within 100m of the gate will trigger a dialog message allowing them to activate the gate. If activated the current ship (with all docked ones) will be warped to the other side.

## PS:

I did not realize the MKI was infact a signature from heyitsmk and not a version at first - sorry...
